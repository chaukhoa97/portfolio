I'm a Front-end developer with 1-year experience and a passion for modern website development. I currently focus on ReactJS and its ecosystem. Willing to continuous learning from more experienced developers and the community. Eager to deal with more demanding challenges and environment.

When I was first starting to learn programming, I used to note all
my should-remember things in{' '}
<span className="text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400">
<a href="https://github.com/chaukhoa97/Storage">
one of my repositories
</a>
</span>
, sometimes in documents or anything that can be written on.

As my coding journey goes on they have started to become
unmanageable and it messes up when I try to find something. So I
come up with an idea - "Why don't I keep those all on a personal
page?". And here it is.
